            <span>Monitoring employees in the workplace may be controversial, but stats speak for themselves: companies
                that use employee monitoring to follow the internet usage of their team report a <b>
                    30% productivity boost</b> within the first month.</span> <br><br>
            <span><a style="color:#4EA819"
                    href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10102-mobile-device-employee-distraction.html">Studies
                    show</a> that <b>people waste as many as 8 hours a week </b>- close
                to one full day a week - on non-work tasks. Note that this time does not include lunch breaks and other
                resting moments throughout the workday, but the time people spend on their mobile phones, surfing the
                web, doing online shopping, etc.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>Now, let's do the calculation: with the average hourly wage of<a style="color:#4EA819;"
                    href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/wages"> $27.12 per
                    hour</a> (as in April 2022), companies in the USA are <b>losing more than $10000 a year</b> on every
                person they employ.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>Boosting your team's productivity by 30% means saving more than $2500 a year on each employee on the
                team. Got a team of 10? Save 25K every year. You get the point -<b> the larger your team, the bigger
                    your savings.</b> Therefore, it's no surprise that as many as 66% of employers have implemented
                employee tracking software and track employee hours in their company.</span>

                    href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/employee-monitoring">Employee monitoring</a> is
                the use of various methods to gather information about the worker's computer activity and locations of
                staff members. There are many and varied types of employee monitoring - here's a selection of the most
                commonly used:</span>
            <h3>Computer monitoring</h3>
            <span>Often used as a synonym for monitoring employees' computer and internet usage. Time tracking software
                collects data about programs, apps and URL's a person has used during the workday, and for how long.
                That way, managers can track employee hours and <b>make sure the company's time is used
                    productively.</b></span>
            <h3>Call monitoring</h3>
            <span><a style="color:#4EA819"
                    href="https://www.talkdesk.com/blog/quality-call-monitoring-in-a-call-center/">Phone monitoring</a>
                is mostly used at call centers for reasons of quality control. Recording employees' interactions with
                clients allows managers to make sure that everyone provides customer service according to the company's
                standards.</span>
